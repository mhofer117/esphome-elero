# Looking for a new maintainer

This project is looking for a new maintainer. After having invested way too much time in remote-controlling my blinds, I was finally able to run proper cables to all of them and to implement a centralised control system. The code for driving wired blinds, especially the RolTop-J series, is available [here](https://github.com/andyboeh/esphome-elero_wired).

# Elero Remote Control Component for ESPHome

This project is heavily based on the work of two other people:

  * All encryption/decryption structures copied from https://github.com/QuadCorei8085/elero_protocol (MIT)
  * All remote handling based on code from https://github.com/stanleypa/eleropy (GPLv3)

## Goal and Status

Ultimately, this component should allow you to control Elero blinds with the
bidirectional protocol directly from Home Assistant using an ESP32 with a CC1101
module attached. Apart from SPI (MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS) only GDO0 is required (in contrast to the other projects, GDO2 is not needed - it's not available on my module so I configured the CC1101 a bit differently).

The current code can transmit and simulate the TempoTel 2 that I have. Since some values are different to the two projects mentioned above, I'm not sure which/if this has an impact. For this reason, various aspects of the protocol can be configured on a per-cover basis (see the respective section).

Please be advised that this is very early development make, features might not work as intended!

## Getting the blind address and other values

You need to have an existing remote control configure and connected to to your blind. This component only supports faking an existing blind, it is not possible to learn it as a new remote. In order to accomplish this, start out with an empty configuration **and add a fake cover** (otherwise, you get a compile error). Then, enable logging and listen to your blind communication. Do the following:

  1. Select a blind. On a TempoTel 2, this triggers reading the blind state. You should see a message like the following in your log. If there are multiple lines, look for the line where `src`, `bwd` and `fwd` all have the same values.
  ```
  len=29, cnt=45, typ=0x6a, typ2=0x00, hop=0a, syst=01, chl=09, src=0x908bef, bwd=0x908bef, fwd=0x908bef, #dst=01, dst=e039c9, rssi=-84.0, lqi=47, crc= 1, payload=[0x00 0x04 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00]
  ```

  2. Look at the lines. You now know: 
    - `pck_inf1`=`0x6a`
    - `pck_inf2` = `0x00`
    - `hop` = `0x0a`
    - `channel` = `9`
    - `remote_address` = `0x908bef`
    - `blind_address` = `e039c9`
    - `payload_1` = `0x00`
    - `payload_2` = `0x04`
    - `command_check` = `0x00`
  3. Press the UP, DOWN and STOP buttons consecutively and check the log again. The very last byte of the payload doesn't matter, the fifth byte is the command to send. An exemplary UP command (`0x20`) looks like this:
  ```
    len=29, cnt=46, typ=0x6a, typ2=0x00, hop=0a, syst=01, chl=09, src=0x908bef, bwd=0x908bef, fwd=0x908bef, #dst=01, dst=e039c9, rssi=-84.0, lqi=47, crc= 1, payload=[0x00 0x04 0x00 0x00 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x40]
  ```
  You are looking for packets with `len=29`. Those with `len=27` are something else (don't know what).

  4. Add all required information to the configuration file and check. Your blinds should start moving.

## Position Control

This implementation does not support intermediate positions. However, by estimating the time the cover is travelling, the cover can be stopped in any desired position. This feature is experimental and it might be off.

## Tilt Control

Any tilt value > 0 will send out the tilt command. At the moment, setting tilt to 0 will not send out any command as I do not have any blinds supporting tilt.

## Troubleshooting

  1. No log output when pressing buttons: Check that the wiring is correct. If that's fine, your frequency might have an offset. I had to set my module to the values `0xc0`, `0x71` and `0x21` whereas the default is `0x7a`, `0x71` and `0x21`.
  2. Blind control doesn't work: Carefully check all values and compare with the real remote. Apart from the `cnt` value, all values need to match!

## Tested configurations

This project was tested on two different configurations:

  1. D1 Mini ESP32 + 433MHz CC1101 module. Bad range and limited reception, but generally working.
  2. WT32-ETH01 + 868MHz CC1101 module from a canibalized RWE Smart Home central. Very good range and excellent reception.
